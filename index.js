$("h1").addClass("big-title margin-50");
$("button")

//Just as you can add a class, so can you remove a class
//$("h1").removeClass("big-title"); //This would remove the class of big title, which would essentially remove all of the CSS that 
$("h1").hasClass("margin-50"); //This will output a boolean of true in the console bc my h1 element does, in fact, have a class of margin-50
